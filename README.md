Requirements
---

- CUDA 8.0
- PCL 1.8
- FLANN
- Boost
- lapack, blas


Usage
---

```
emicp [options]
```

This demo application finds R and t such that `min ||X - (R*Y+t) ||` for given 3D point sets X and Y.

At the start, the demo application popups a window where two point sets are shown.

### Options

#### Files of 3D point sets:
```
-pointFileX=filename
-pointFileY=filename
[string] Filename of two 3D point sets. Required.
```
Format of file: in each line, x y z coordinates are stored. Thatâ€™s all. Number of points are specified with Xsize and Ysize options.

#### Reduction number of points:
```
-leaf_size=**
    [float] Leaf size to use for downsampling the pointclouds using PCL's voxel grid filter. default: 0.005
```


#### EM-ICP parameters:
````
-sigma_p2=***
    [float] initial value for the main loop. sigma_p2 <- sigma_p2 * sigma_factor  at the end of each iteration while sigma_p2 > sigam_inf. default: 0.01
-sigma_inf=***
    [float] minimum value of sigma_p2. default: 0.00001
-sigma_factor=***
    [float] facfor for reducing sigma_p2. default: 0.9
-d_02=***
    [float] values for outlier (see EM-ICP paper). default: 0.01
````

#### MISC:
````
-notimer
    No timer is shown.
````

####  Save and load R, t:
```
-saveRTtoFile=filename
    save the estimated rotation matrix and translation vector. default: nothing saved.
-loadRTfromFile=filename
    load initial values for rotation matrix R and translation vector t. default: no values are loaded, and set R=3x3 identity matrix, t=zero vector.
```

Save and load format: R and t are stored in row-wise.
```
r11 r12 r13
r21 r22 r23
r31 r32 r33
tx ty tz
```

Build the demo application
---

### prepare packages:
```
sudo apt-get install libpcl-1.7-all-dev libflann-dev libboost-all-dev ccache libatlas-dev libblas-dev liblapack-dev cmake
```

### build
```
mkdir build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=1 ..
make
```




How to use the API
---

### interfaces:
```
void      emicp(const pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ>::Ptr cloud_targetX,
		const pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ>::Ptr cloud_sourceY,float* h_R, float* h_t, registrationParameters param)
```

To use these functions,
compile your program with `emicp.cu`, along with  `3dregistration.h`, `cloud2data.cpp`, and `findRTfromS.cpp`.

### description
```
cloud_targetX, cloud_sourceY [Input]
```
Specify the pointers to pcl::PointCloud storing point sets X and Y.

```
float* h_R, float* h_t [Input/Output]
```
- On entry, initial values for rotation matrix R and translation vector t must be given. Usually, R=3x3 identity matrix, t=zero vector.
- On exit, estimated R and t are stored.
- Order of elements:
```
h_R[0], ..., h_R[8]: r11 r12 r13 r21 r22 r23 r31 r32 r33
h_t[0], ..., h_t[2] : tx,ty,tz
```

```
registrationParameters param [Input]
```
parameters for alignment. set values by yourself.
see 3dregistration.h and usage of demo (described above).
